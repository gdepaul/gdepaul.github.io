            <h1>Hi there!</h1>
            <p>My name is Greg DePaul. I am a fourth year doctoral student at UC Davis studying Applied Mathematics. My advisor is <a style="float:none" href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~ecarlsson/">Erik Carlsson</a>. My research interests are in computational topology and algebraic geometry and their applications to data science and machine learning. Specifically, my work is in topological inference and algebraic statistics.
                In my free time, I also enjoy road biking. This picture was taken while I participated in the 2019 AIDS LifeCycle, where I biked 545 miles from SF to LA.
